  <h2>In a total wasteland... everything goes</h2>
  <p style="color:  white;">
    Each fighter carries a unique backstoryâ€”some seek vengeance for lost loved ones, while others fight to reclaim their shattered homes. The tournament, governed by a shadowy council known as the Keepers, promises riches and power to the victor, but at a steep price: failure means death in the unforgiving arena. <br><br>
    As players engage in intense one-on-one battles, they must navigate treacherous terrain and use salvaged weapons, crafting their own strategies to emerge as the ultimate champion. In this harsh new world, only the strongest survive, and every duel could be their last. Will you rise to power, or will you become another ghost in the wasteland?
